# quantbullet

`quantbullet` is a toolkit designed for streamlined quantitative analysis in finance. The goals for this package are:

1. To provide a practical set of tools for prototyping quantitative research ideas.
2. To integrate and test contemporary research findings, primarily from academic sources, ensuring they're actionable.

While I initially developed this package for my own needs, I intend to maintain it consistently. If it assists others in their endeavors, I consider that a success.

## Installation

```bash
$ pip install quantbullet
